Patient model
The Patient model represents users who book appointments and receive treatment. It captures personal details like contact information and address, and links to appointments and prescriptions indirectly.

Open the Patient.java file
src/main/java/com/project/back_end/models/Patient.java
Open Patient.java in IDE

Add the following attributes along with getters and setters:
id: private Long – Auto-incremented primary key
name: private String – Patient's full name (required, 3–100 characters)
email: private String – Valid email address (required, must match email format)
password: private String – Password (required, at least 6 characters)
phone: private String – Phone number (required, must be 10 digits)
address: private String – Patient's address (required, max 255 characters)

Hints
Annotate the class with @Entity
Apply validation annotations like:
@NotNull
@Size(min = 3, max = 100)
@Email
@Size(min = 6)
@Pattern(regexp = "\\d{10}")
Add @Size(max = 255) to the address field
Don't forget to include standard getters and setters

Tasks
Validate inputs to ensure clean and accurate patient data
Follow consistent design and annotation patterns
Prepare this model for use in authentication and reporting features

package com.project.back_end.models;

public class Patient {
// @Entity annotation:
//    - Marks the class as a JPA entity, meaning it represents a table in the database.
//    - Required for persistence frameworks (e.g., Hibernate) to map the class to a database table.

// 1. 'id' field:
//    - Type: private Long
//    - Description:
//      - Represents the unique identifier for each patient.
//      - The @Id annotation marks it as the primary key.
//      - The @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) annotation auto-generates the ID value when a new record is inserted into the database.

// 2. 'name' field:
//    - Type: private String
//    - Description:
//      - Represents the patient's full name.
//      - The @NotNull annotation ensures that the patient's name is required.
//      - The @Size(min = 3, max = 100) annotation ensures that the name length is between 3 and 100 characters. 
//      - Provides validation for correct input and user experience.


// 3. 'email' field:
//    - Type: private String
//    - Description:
//      - Represents the patient's email address.
//      - The @NotNull annotation ensures that an email address must be provided.
//      - The @Email annotation validates that the email address follows a valid email format (e.g., patient@example.com).

// 4. 'password' field:
//    - Type: private String
//    - Description:
//      - Represents the patient's password for login authentication.
//      - The @NotNull annotation ensures that a password must be provided.
//      - The @Size(min = 6) annotation ensures that the password must be at least 6 characters long.

// 5. 'phone' field:
//    - Type: private String
//    - Description:
//      - Represents the patient's phone number.
//      - The @NotNull annotation ensures that a phone number must be provided.
//      - The @Pattern(regexp = "^[0-9]{10}$") annotation validates that the phone number must be exactly 10 digits long.

// 6. 'address' field:
//    - Type: private String
//    - Description:
//      - Represents the patient's address.
//      - The @NotNull annotation ensures that the address must be provided.
//      - The @Size(max = 255) annotation ensures that the address does not exceed 255 characters in length, providing validation for the address input.


// 7. Getters and Setters:
//    - Standard getter and setter methods are provided for all fields: id, name, email, password, phone, and address.
//    - These methods allow access and modification of the fields of the Patient class.
