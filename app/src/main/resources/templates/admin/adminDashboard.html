adminDashboard.html (Thyemeleaf Code)
In this section, you’ll build the main dashboard for Admin users. This page will serve as the control panel for managing doctors — allowing admins to view, add, delete, and filter doctor profiles.

The page should include a search bar, dropdown filters (by specialty or time), and a dynamic list of doctor cards. You'll also add a modal popup for adding new doctors, which will be triggered by a button click.

This layout will eventually be connected to your backend and populated using JavaScript services.

Tips:
The admin is validated first using token and userRole.
Include modal forms for adding new doctors.

HTML Code
Open the HTML File:
Open adminDashboard.html located at app/src/main/resources/templates/admin/adminDashboard.html.
Open adminDashboard.html in IDE

Add Basic HTML Structure:

Use <!DOCTYPE html> and <html lang="en">.
In the <head> tag, include:
<meta charset="UTF-8">

A <title> for the page (Admin Dashboard)

CSS links for page-specific and global styles:

 <link rel="stylesheet" th:href="@{/assets/css/adminDashboard.css}">
 <link rel="stylesheet" th:href="@{/assets/css/style.css}">

JavaScript files with defer:

Utility and rendering logic:

<script th:src="@{/js/render.js}" defer></script>
<script th:src="@{/js/util.js}" defer></script>

Layout components:

<script th:src="@{/js/components/header.js}" defer></script>
<script th:src="@{/js/components/footer.js}" defer></script>

Create Body Layout:

Inside the <body>, structure the layout as follows:
Wrap everything in <div class="container"> and then <div class="wrapper">.
Insert <div id="header"></div> to load the dynamic header. header.js will provide a button labeled Add Doctor with a unique ID to trigger the modal.
Create a <main class="main-content"> section containing:
A search bar using <input type="text" id="searchBar" placeholder="search by doctor name" />
A filter section with two <select> dropdowns for:
Sorting by time
Filtering by specialty
A <div id="content"></div> to dynamically inject the list of doctors.
Add <div id="footer"></div> for the dynamic footer.
Add Modal for Adding Doctor:

At the end of the <body>, add a hidden modal:
<div id="modal" class="modal">
  <span id="closeModal" class="close">&times;</span>
  <div id="modal-body"></div>
</div>

Include JavaScript File:

Just before the closing </body>, include the service script for admin dashboard and doctorCard:
<script type="module" src="../js/services/adminDashboard.js" defer></script>
<script type="module" src="../js/components/doctorCard.js" defer></script>

Step-by-Step Explanation of `adminDashboard.html`
This file creates the Admin Dashboard interface for managing doctor-related data 
with search, filter, and modal functionality.


1. Declare the Document Type

   * Use `<!DOCTYPE html>` to ensure HTML5 standards for consistent rendering across browsers.

2. Begin the HTML Document with Thymeleaf Namespace

   * Add the `<html>` tag with `xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"` to allow Thymeleaf-specific attributes in Spring-based apps.

3. Head Section – Metadata and Resources

   * Open the `<head>` section for meta info and links to assets and scripts.

4. Set Character Encoding

   * Use UTF-8 to support all characters and prevent encoding issues.

5. Set the Favicon

   * Add a favicon for browser tabs using Thymeleaf pathing: 
     `<link rel="icon" type="image/png" th:href="@{/assets/images/logo/logo.png}" />`.

6. Set the Page Title

   * Give the page a title, e.g., `"Admin Dashboard"`, which will show in the browser tab.

7. Link CSS Stylesheets

   * Include dashboard-specific styles and global site-wide styles:
     - `adminDashboard.css` for layout and design of this page.
     - `style.css` for shared UI components.

8. Link JavaScript Files (with `defer`)

   * Use Thymeleaf's `th:src` to include JS components and utilities:
     - `render.js` (rendering content)
     - `util.js` (utility functions)
     - `header.js` and `footer.js` (for dynamic header/footer)
   * Use `defer` so scripts execute after the HTML is fully parsed.

9. Close the Head and Begin the Body

    * Start the visible part of the webpage. `onload="renderContent()"` is used to call a function when the page is ready.

10. Create the Container

    * Add a `div` with class `container` for layout control.

11. Add a Wrapper Inside the Container

    * Wrap page elements with a `wrapper` div to maintain consistent spacing and organization.

12. Insert a Header Placeholder

    * Add `<div id="header"></div>` for injecting the header via JavaScript.

13. Define the Main Section

    * Use `<main class="main-content">` for the central dashboard area.

14. Add a Search Bar

    * Add an input field with `id="searchBar"` for admin to search content dynamically.

15. Add Filter Dropdowns

    * Use two `<select>` elements:
      - One for time (AM/PM).
      - One for filtering by medical specialty (Cardiologist, Dentist, etc.).

16. Add Content Display Area

    * Insert a `<div id="content"></div>` for dynamic injection of doctor cards or data.

17. Add a Footer Placeholder

    * Use `<div id="footer"></div>` for a JavaScript-rendered footer.

18. Add Modal Structure

    * Include a modal with:
      - A close button (`&times;`)
      - A content area (`#modal-body`) for displaying popup information or forms.

19. Include Page-Specific JavaScript Modules

    * Load JavaScript specific to the admin dashboard:
      - `adminDashboard.js` for dashboard logic.
      - `doctorCard.js` for rendering doctor information cards.
    * Use `type="module"` and `defer` for modern and non-blocking loading.

    HINT:
        `<script type="module" src="../../static/js/adminDashboard.js" defer></script>`
        `<script type="module" src="../../static/js/doctorDashboard.js" defer></script>`
        
        
20. Close the Body and HTML Tags

    * Finish the structure by properly closing all tags.
