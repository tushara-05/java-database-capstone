index.html
In this step, you’ll create the initial landing page where users can choose their role in the Clinic system — Admin, Doctor, or Patient. This page sets the stage for a personalized user experience by allowing the user to select their identity, which will be used to tailor the dashboard and access permissions.

You'll include buttons for each role, and store the selected role in the browser's localStorage so it can be accessed on subsequent pages. Later, you'll also trigger login modals based on the selected role.

Let's begin by creating the HTML layout and adding placeholders for the necessary scripts and components.

HTML code
Open the index.html file app/src/main/resources/static/index.html
Open index.html in IDE

Add the following basic HTML structure:

Use <!DOCTYPE html> and <html lang="en">.
Inside <head>, include:
<meta charset="UTF-8">

<title> for the page.

Favicon <link rel="icon" ... />.

CSS links (index.css, style.css).

Example:

   <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/index.css">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css">

JS links for utility (util.js, render.js) with defer keyword to avoid render-blocking i.e. defer allows the browser to keep parsing and rendering the HTML while it downloads the JS. .

Example :

   <script src="./js/util.js" defer></script>
   <script src="./js/render.js" defer></script>

JS links for components (header.js, footer.js).

Example :

   <script src="./js/components/header.js" defer></script>
   <script src="./js/components/footer.js" defer></script>

In the <body>, add the following content inside a <main> tag:

Wrap the content inside a div with class name container <div class="container">.
Inside the container div create another <div> with class name wrapper (<div class="wrapper">) to group the sections.
Add placeholders for Header (<div id="header"></div>) and placeholder for Footer (<div id="footer"></div>).
In <main class="main-content">, create:
A heading in h2 tag : “Select Your Role”.
Buttons for each role: Admin, Doctor, Patient.
Use onclick for dynamic role selection.
Also assign unique ids to these elements for easy DOM access in JavaScript.
Add a modal that is hidden by default and appears when triggered by an event listener.

Create a hidden modal <div id="modal" class="modal"> with:
Close button (id="closeModal").
Dynamic content area (id="modal-body").
Include the JavaScript file at the end of the <body> or just before the <body> tag to ensure the DOM is fully loaded.

Use <script type="module" src="../js/services/index.js" defer></script> to include the service for role selection and modal behavior.

Step-by-Step Explanation of `index.html`.
This file allows users to select a role (Admin, Patient, Doctor) 
and triggers modal-based login functionality.

1. Label the File

   * Add a comment at the very top to identify the file as `index.html`. This helps developers stay organized.

2. Declare Document Type

   * Use the declaration for HTML5 so browsers know how to render the page correctly.

3. Start the HTML Document

   * Begin the HTML structure and set the document language to English to improve accessibility and SEO `lang="en"`.

4. Head Section (Metadata and Resources)

   * Open the `<head>` section which contains settings and links that don’t show up visually.

5. Set Character Encoding

   * Specify UTF-8 encoding to support most global characters and symbols.

6. Set the Page Title

   * Give the page a name (e.g., "Select Role") that appears on the browser tab.

7. Add a Favicon

   * Link to an icon (like a logo) that will appear in the browser tab from the address `href="../assets/images/logo/Logo.png"`

8. Link Stylesheets

   * Add a page-specific stylesheet for layout and design.
   * Also include a global stylesheet for shared site-wide styles.

   HINT:
      `<link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/css/index.css">`
      `<link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/css/style.css">`

9. Add JavaScript Files with `defer`

   * Link utility and rendering JavaScript files (e.g., `util.js`, `render.js`).
   * Include scripts for rendering components like header and footer.
   * Use the `defer` attribute so they load after the HTML is parsed.

   HINT:
      `<script src="../js/util.js" defer></script>`
      `<script src="../js/render.js" defer></script>`
      `<script src="../js/components/header.js" defer></script>`
      `<script src="../js/components/footer.js" defer></script>`
      
10. Close the Head and Open the Body

    * Wrap up metadata and begin the visible page content.

11. Create a Container

    * Add a main container to hold all page elements and apply layout constraints.

12. Use a Wrapper for Structure

    * Inside the container, add a wrapper to group header, main, and footer sections logically.

13. Insert a Header Placeholder

    * Add a `div` that will be dynamically filled by JavaScript with the site’s header.

14. Define the Main Section

    * Use a semantic `<main>` tag to hold the central content of the page.

15. Add a Heading for Role Selection

    * Display a heading like “Select Your Role” to instruct users.

16. Add Buttons for Roles

    * Create buttons for each role: Admin, Patient, and Doctor.
    * Assign unique identifiers or `onclick` handlers to them as needed.

17. Insert a Footer Placeholder

    * Add a `div` that will be dynamically filled by JavaScript with the site’s footer.

18. Create a Modal Structure

    * Add a modal overlay for popups (like login forms).
    * Include a close button and an inner container for dynamic content.

19. Load Page-Specific Logic Module

    * Use a `<script type="module">` tag to load the role selection logic (e.g., `index.js`).
    * Ensure it’s deferred so it doesn’t block HTML rendering.

20. Close the Body and HTML Tags

    * Properly close all opened tags to complete the document structure.
